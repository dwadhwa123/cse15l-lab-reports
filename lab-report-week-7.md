# Week 7 Lab Report

## Part 1

/start<Enter>cebase<Esc>/start<Enter>cebase<Esc>/start<Enter>cebase<Esc>:w<Enter>

There are 3 instances of the start variable in the getFiles method including the paramter. Therefore, I used the sequence /start<Enter>cebase<Esc> 3 times to change all 3 instances to base and then used the :w<Enter> to save the changes.

Typing /start<Enter> moves the cursor to the beginning of the first instnace of start in the file. I did not have to move the cursor at all because it started at the top and the getFiles method was at the start of the file.

Typing ce deleted the word start and changed the mode automatically to insert mode.

Typing base<Esc> changed the word to base and went back into normal mode. 
I repeated this sequence of commands 3 times.

After changing all 3 instances of the start variable to base, I typed :w<Enter> which saved the changes of DocSearchServer.java.
